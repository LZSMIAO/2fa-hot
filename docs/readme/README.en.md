<!-- website:intro:start -->

A multifunctional online 2FA tool with a Minecraft-inspired design. Paste a 2FA secret to get the current verification code. Supports direct links, with code generation handled locally.

It automatically detects and switches to batch data, and recognizes multiple secret formats—whether it is some fucked-up format copied from Excel, or your customers not knowing what they are doing and copying their password along with the secret, it recognizes the input and gives the appropriate prompts.

An accessible, step-by-step guide with optional voice narration teaches you how to use a secret to log into an account!

More features are being integrated…

## What exactly can it do

- Single and batch codes: supports Base32 secrets and otpauth:// configuration links.
- QR import: images, drag and drop, or camera; supports Google Authenticator exports, multiple accounts and multi-part exports. Collect all parts, then select the accounts you need.
- Direct links: supports fragment links that display the current code, with one-click copying and batch link generation.
- Local history: off by default, with opt-in storage, optional encryption, backup and restore.
- 30 languages: mobile layouts and light/dark themes. Need help? Follow the diamond sword through the tutorial.

Supports TOTP (SHA-1/SHA-256/SHA-512, 6/8 digits) and Steam Guard (5 characters, 30 seconds). For Steam, enter a shared_secret or paste maFile JSON content. HOTP code generation is not supported; HOTP/MD5 accounts in migration files can be parsed and exported.

## How to use it

- Copy your 2FA secret and paste it into 2fa.hot, or import a QR code.
- Copy and use the current code before the countdown ends.

## Secret storage and access

- Homepage code generation and QR recognition happen entirely in your browser.
- When you enable local history, records are stored in your browser. You can set a password for encryption, or leave it unset and view records directly.
- New direct links use `/2fa#SECRET`. The secret and verification parameters after `#` are read locally by your browser and are not sent to the hosting service with the page request. Legacy `/2fa/SECRET` links still send the secret with the request; use the new format instead. Full links still contain secrets and may remain in browser history.

Finally, do not share them publicly or with anyone you do not trust. Forgotten local-history passphrases cannot be recovered.

## Domain drama

I originally wanted 2fa.mc, but gave up because I couldn't register **2FA®** to submit to Monaco's domain registry.
...What if I kept a straight face while writing this?
Then .HOT came along. Fine, fine, I'll admit it: that's sexy. We're going back.

## Why did I make this? Reinventing the wheel?

Friends working in cross-border e-commerce need to log into accounts for tasks such as managing media accounts, while also considering security. Helping more friends with similar needs, as well as people just getting started online, was the starting point.
There are many similar online tools, including ones that generate codes through direct links. But if you didn't know, opening a URL containing a secret, such as `/2fa/SECRET` or `?secret=SECRET`, sends the secret in an HTTP request. The remote website service or CDN receives that data and can record and retain it through access logs, monitoring or application logging. In other words, secrets in those requests may be stored in plain text; if you also pasted an account + password + 2FA, and the site uploaded and retained those too... BOOM! Of course, whether it actually retains them depends on its implementation, settings and privacy policy :))

<summary>Story</summary>

...Around 2021, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, humanity entered the AI era. Since then, I keep seeing people abusing it—even professional programmers pulling this shit—taking just 5 minutes to generate a fucking gradient, misaligned frontend with 100 different UI design styles and 1,000 elements.
Like certain people who won't even dare reply to my messages, using AI to throw together a shoddy garbage system and making a fortune selling it to gray-market users.
…All of this makes me sick. I crawled out of bed and threw up again and again. Unfortunately, I wasn’t caught steadily.

Everything I want to do, rich people have already done. Almost all of 2fa.hot was made through Vibe Coding—of course, I revised it until I was barely satisfied before launching. Like some projects my colleagues and I work on, we want to launch soon, but can't stop revising them until they meet our standards, until they have never gone live. Some projects might one day become familiar to those of you reading this, although you won't know we made them. It feels like going back six years, opening Premiere Pro, throwing myself into creating and never getting tired of it. Yet now I can't make videos anymore. It makes you think.
Everything I want to say has been said before. I'm not against AI. Six years ago, I studied the humanities; I might not even have known how the fuck to put a website online. I hope certain people can use AI well. It can help you do things, but it can never become you. Ever. Please don't let it replace your thoughts or your life; don't use it to produce a design you can't even be bothered to play with yourself, full of bugs and logic that ruin the experience… Open it on localhost and polish it another 100 times. Otherwise, it isn't yours. Don't release it and disgust everyone. Sell it? You don't deserve to. You'll just keep scrambling around in gray-market industries.
The fairness I want is all a fiction invented by the unfair. I know I can't change today's fast-paced life, or stop those things. Them.
